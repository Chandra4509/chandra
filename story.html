    <section>
        <p>I opposed marriage until now, but today I realized I was wrong. Let’s understand this in detail, or you can leave.</p>

        <p>First, let me tell you where I come from. I belong to a lower-middle-class family of four members: my father, mother, younger brother, and me. We have been living in a rented house for my entire life. It consists of one big room (a bed for four people, a study table, a small corner for idol worship, a TV, and an almirah) and one small room (the kitchen, my mom’s sewing machine, and a cycle stand). My father left Odisha, his hometown, in the 1990s for labor work around India. Some events occurred, and he and my mother (both barely educated) settled in West Bengal in this rented house, leaving Odisha. They thought it would be for a few years, but here I am.</p>

        <p>They are the best parents (I’m not going into everything they did and are doing for us from birth to now, but when I say they are the best parents, I really mean it. That’s how parents should be, though they have many faults; I’ll talk about that more in another blog). I grew up very well. Sometimes, I forgot I was poor. I went to a school where upper-middle-class kids go, and on top of that, it was an English medium school. My mom took loans to educate us, thinking I would pay them off by landing a high-paying job in the future.</p>

        <p>But I turned out differently somehow. I started to think, talk, and act very differently from societal rules, regulations, and traditions. Not somehow—I do know how, but to tell you, I’d have to talk about my entire childhood. Let’s skip that for now. We’ll focus on the topic of marriage. I’ll tell you more about how I am when the need arises.</p>

        <p>Love and marriage—the concept first became relevant to me through the media (this part is common in every Indian child’s life, I guess, because we’re too scared to talk about it with our parents). But the thing is, Indian media is messed up when showing things like love and marriage. It always plays at extreme points, like “love ke liye kuch bhi karega” or “love chhod kar IAS officer.” Happy, perfect marriages or always-quarreling, toxic ones.</p>

        <p>Then I started to see real love relationships and marriages around me. As an under-confident, insecure, and skill-less kid throughout most of my school life, and to top it off, poor, I never had a girlfriend. So, at that time, the only relationships I could see were those of my handsome friends. They were cool and confident, so they got nice girls. The real marriages I saw were those of my parents, neighboring uncles and aunties, bhaiyas and bhabhis, and old couples around me.</p>

        <p>I don’t know if you thought the same as me, but earlier, I never saw them as having a love relationship. I only thought physical love was love. But as I grew up, I realized relationships are more complex; they exist on a wide range between two extremes (perfect and totally toxic). Every relationship doesn’t fall on a single point in that spectrum; rather, it moves to and fro between several points.</p>

        <p>I saw young people in relationships express love physically and sometimes fight. Adult people in marriages may quarrel now and then, but the next moment, they share something and laugh. To me, it was ungraspable. For most of my teenage and early adult life, I imagined my parents to be a bad couple—good to us brothers but bad for each other. They fought immensely over small things. But the next moment, I would see them taking care of each other—not overtly, but they did. I saw it. The same happens in most families around us too. Some couples may be more passionate, but they are young with a kid under 10 or no kids yet. I predicted they would become like my mom and dad after a few years. Imagining myself in their shoes, it felt exhausting, time-consuming, and overwhelming. It’s not like the movies at all. There are unpredictable consequences to things.</p>

        <p>What if I marry, and she dies? (Did I mention I’m a huge overthinker and keep passions, goals, and hobbies like minorities?) Due to all these conundrums related to marriage and relationships, I thought I’d never marry, have a relationship, and lead a life like greats—Vivekananda, APJ Abdul Kalam, and many more.</p>

        <p>I became a loner as I grew older (I still am) because I think and act differently from society and have hobbies most people don’t love. By "most people," I mean most; nobody listens to me and mostly ignores me. I don’t love being around people because they laugh at my nerdy hobbies and abstract, philosophical (or rather, fantasy-like) thoughts. Over time, I started to think people were dumb and I was wise, but I forgot that I, too, am “people.” This hate developed at a young age, and I began isolating myself.</p>

        <p>That’s not the whole story, though. I’m an extrovert when I’m with people. Even though they make fun of me, I won’t stop talking or sharing my two cents. Occasionally, I come across people who feel like home, and I befriend them. But once I’m alone, I prefer to stay alone for as long as possible. This is more like how I am.</p>

        <p>Then puberty hits me. And it came to me, the word for 'it' is “libido.” I started coming (pun intended). I slightly changed my opinions. I decided relationships and marriage were bad, but sex was not, so I decided to pursue only sex. However, for all the reasons you’ve read, I couldn’t get a girlfriend, even though I wanted to. Many thoughts popped up whenever I approached a girl: “She’s way better than me,” “Look at those boobs,” “I’m poor—where can I take her on a date?”, "boobs", “I don’t have a bike like the other guys,” “She doesn’t seem interested in science, universe—what’s wrong with her?” and more thoughts of boobs. So, with all these thoughts, I couldn’t talk properly to a girl. And school life ended.</p>

        <p>Then came college, and things changed. I fell in love with a lovely girl. I swear to God (just a figure of speech, I believe in Allah, just kidding, both of them don't exist, there is only one God, Krishna), for the first time in my life, I thought about marriage and living happily ever after. Why? She had totally different thoughts, hobbies, and actions than me. “Opposites attract” may not be wrong here, but still, I loved her. However, due to my ugly, insecure self and the earlier mentioned problems in my life and with me, I lost her. It took me a year to fully recover. Now, she’s a good friend. And the love is gone. There’s a quote, “Funny how we love to hate the people who failed to love us back.” No, I’ve never read Rithvik Singh, nor do I plan to; I just saw the quote somewhere, and it stuck. So don't hate anyone after a breakup.</p>

        <p>So, I’m alone again. I thought I’d go back to the “no love, no marriage, only sex” plan. Not that it worked the first time, but the failure of not getting sex hurts less than not getting her.</p>

        <p>Now, here’s the actual point: Swami Vivekananda and Abdul Kalam found peace in their work. They found solitude. They were happy. So, it’s okay for them not to marry.</p>

        <p>Finding solitude in your work is real; it’s said in the Gita, “Karm kiye ja.” Sometimes, even if you find solitude in work, you may still want to keep someone close—people you call family.</p>

        <p>There’s a difference between solitude and loneliness. Loneliness is coming home and having no one to share something with; solitude is when you never leave home metaphorically, because you, the individual, is your own home. But solitude is rare. Humans are social by nature. Social media today portrays solitude as cool, but it’s unlikely that every person can achieve it. Not every person can do what he loves. So, most people are left with loneliness.</p>

        <p>Loneliness hurts. Sometimes, it’s greater than physical pain. This is the feeling I get every now and then. At nights, sometimes after I wake up, sometimes when travelling. So I didn't find solitude, should I continue to feel pain by being lonely till I find solitude and even if I found solitude in my work, what will happen then when I am not working.</p>

        <p>Most people are like me. They don’t want to marry or enter a relationship, not because they’ve found solitude in their work or feel content with themselves and nature, but because due to their childhoods and past relationships, they overthink and get anxious about the future with their partners. But life is like that. We don’t know what will happen tomorrow, yet we sleep today with an alarm set for early morning. So, why be afraid of relationships, love, and marriage? It’s a beautiful thing. Embrace it.</p>

        <p>There’s a chance it won’t work out—that’s fine. Nature made us serial monogamists for a reason. Try again. Don’t be lonely.</p>

        <p>Though my parents fought, they share stories, they know they’ve got each other’s backs, they cook together, they watch TV together sometimes, and they laugh together. That’s more lovely than being alone.</p>

        <p>I’m saying all this to myself in third person.</p>

        <p>P.S. – I’m dumb. So all of these thoughts may come out wrong. I don't know. I never know. I also need to love my parents and brother more</p>
